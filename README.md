### Design System

I've tried to do something similar to a Design System in the ui folder, inside components.

### Search

I found no good open search API for products, so I've used the [`openfoodfacts`](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data) one. To request data you'll need to search for an `barcode`, a very popular one, preferentially from an EUA product, the result will be shown in the console. Here some of them:
